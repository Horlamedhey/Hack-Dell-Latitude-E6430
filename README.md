# Dell Latitude E6430 Hackintosh

![System Specs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kinoute/Hack-Dell-Latitude-E6430/master/Pictures/system.png)

I have already a [Hackintosh](https://github.com/kinoute/Hack-Z370-HD3P-i5-8400) at home running smoothly. I was given an old laptop at work, a Dell Latitude E6430, and couldn't resist to try to install macOS on it despite its age. It worked!

## Laptop Specs

* macOS Mojave 10.4.4
* Intel Core i5-3320M 2.6Ghz Turbo 3.3Ghz (2 cores, 4 threads)
* Crucial Ballistix Sport 16GB DDR3-RAM @ 1600 Mhz (BLS8G3N169ES4.16FE)
* Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 Mb
* Crucial MX200 250 GB SSD (Crucial_CT250MX200SSD1)
* 14" HD 1366x768 Screen
* MATSHITA DVD+/-RW UJ8B2

**Note:** My model doesn't have a Nvidia Card. If you have one, my install might not work for you.


### What works:
* Sound (in and out)
* Trackpad with gestures
* USB Ports
* DVD Player
* Webcam (tested with Photobooth)
* LAN/Ethernet
* Fn keys to change volume or brightness
* Sleep/Wake-up
* Battery percentage/status

### Doesn't work natively / Not tested
* Wifi (need to change internal card) ; I use a [TP-Link-TL-WN725N](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/usb-adapter/tl-wn725n/) USB Dongle since I don't own the laptop
* Bluetooth
* SD Card Reader (not tested)
* HDMI/VGA out (not tested yet)

## BIOS

### Flashing your BIOS

First thing you need to do it is flash your BIOS version if you're running an old one like A02/A03. I flashed mine to the A12 version which seems to work fine. If you already have a recent version superior to mine, I can't guarantee that my install will work for you. Some had to downgrade first to A02/A03 then flash to A12 in order to install.

You can find the A12 BIOS here: https://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=TW3TN&osCode=w732&productCode=latitude-e6430&lwp=rt

Read carefully the installation instructions. It's pretty straight-forward: download their `.exe`file and you can start the flashing straight from Windows. It will reboot your machine and finish the work.

### BIOS Settings

Once you have the correct BIOS version, go to the BIOS by using the `F12` key at boot. Click on "Load defaults" then set SATA Operations to `AHCI`, set Boot List Option to `UEFI` and Disable Secure Boot.
